    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of 2015, several cases of patients presenting symptoms of mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis and joint pain were reported by clinicians in South America. Investigation revealed infections with Zika virus, an obscure relative of dengue and chikungunya, that until the late 2000s had caused sporadic benign infections in Africa and Asia. Outbreaks emerged in Micronesia in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013-14, during which an unusual increase in the incidence of severe neurological complications was first noticed. Over the course of 2015 and into 2016, clinicians in Brazil reported an upswing in the numbers of children born with microcephaly. The finger of blame was pointed towards Zika virus, a flavivirus, members of which group had been known to exhibit neurotropism and thereby carry the risk of causing neurological defects. As of March 2016, the epidemiological history and expectations for the ongoing spread of Zika virus were very uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this practical is to demonstrate the tools available for phylogenetic analysis during early outbreak investigation. The aims are to address the following questions:\n",
    "- What was the geographic origin of the 2015/2016 Zika outbreak?\n",
    "- How was the virus related to previous Zika outbreaks?\n",
    "- When did the 2015/2016 Zika virus strain diverge from other variants?\n",
    "- Was there anything special about the 2015/2016 strain?\n",
    "- At what speed was Zika virus spreading through South America?\n",
    "- Could we have predicted the total number of cases?"

    "Distance-based methods are quick and often referred to as dirty. Among the limitations of distance-based methods\n",
    "- The methods are ad hoc algorithms that do something sensible at each step, but do not add up to a principled approach to inference\n",
    "- In particular, there is no explicit model of evolution, making the assumptions difficult to scrutinize\n",
    "- With no probabilistic model of sequence evolution, no theoretical guarantees of performance can be applied to these methods\n",
    "- For the same reason, it is difficult to quantify statistical uncertainty associated, although bootstrapping is commonly employed\n",
    "- Since information is thrown away when summarizing the sequences by pairwise distance alone, distance methods cannot be expected to perform as well as alternatives based on the full data\n",
    "- In practice, these concerns are born out with worse empirical performance than more sophisticated alternatives\n",

    "- Unbiased for large datasets\n",
    "- Amenable to formal hypothesis tests and construction of confidence intervals\n",

    "ML methods attempt to find the tree and branch lengths that are most compatible with the data. They consider how probable the observed data would have been for different trees and branch lengths. No matter how improbable the observed data are, they optimize the tree and branch lengths so that no alternative tree and branch lengths could make the observed data more probable.\n",

    "Since maximum likelihood methods must be highly optimized, most widely-used methods are available as stand-alone command line programs. We will use *PhyML* which is simple to use and fast up around 200 sequences. Beyond that there are more specialized tools such as *RAxML*."

Since the population size is changing, it is necessary to specify that the time units are scaled by the size of the population at the present (i.e. at the time of sampling).

    "Often the phylogenies of an exponentially growing population are referred to as star-shaped. This is shorthand and shouldn't be taken too literally. Only under exceptionally strong growth would the distortion of branch lengths be so strong as to generate phylogenies appearing to have no internal branching structure, in which case the overall compression of the phylogeny would be extreme, likely resulting in very low diversity. Don't forget that estimation of the phylogeny itself is also subject to statistical uncertainty."

    "\n",
    "You can see that the MCMC explores the posterior distribution by taking a *random walk* through the parameter values. This causes the evident *auto-correlation* in parameter values from iteration to iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first million iterations are greyed out. This phase of the run is called the burn-in before which the MCMC has reliably converged on the posterior distribution from its initial parameter values. Identifying the length of the burn-in is an inexact science, and we just used the BEAST default of one million iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the burn-in, the hairy caterpillar should look fairly flat with relatively modest auto-correlation. If the caterpillar is obviously skewiff or the auto-correlation shows a long *lag* (evident as waves) this means that the MCMC is not *mixing* well, i.e. the random walk is not efficiently exploring the parameter values. A poorly-mixing MCMC needs running for longer, or the proposals used in the random walk need optimizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful heuristic for how well the MCMC is mixing is the *ESS* (effective sample size), shown in the left side bar for each parameter. The ESS, which is calculated for all iterations after the burn-in, takes account of the auto-correlation to calculate the approximate number of *independent* samples from the posterior distribution. An ESS below 100 suggests serious problems with the MCMC. Every parameter listed in the left side bar needs an adequate ESS.\n",

    "The next step is to evaluate *convergence* of the MCMC. This was the reason for running multiple chains. In the top left panel labelled *Trace Files*, click first on `beast.mcmc1.log` and then hold Ctrl and click `beast.mcmc2.log`. As you Ctrl-click the second run, you should see its trace super-imposed on top of the trace of the first run. If the two runs have both converged, they should lie on top of each other. You can improve the graph by dragging the right frame of the Tracer window to widen the window until the *Colour by* drop-down list is visible. Select *Colour by: Trace File*. This will make the second trace purple. The two traces should both be well-mixed and should not show systematic differences such as a different mean value. Failure to converge is often accompanied by bad mixing, which will make the two traces clearly non-overlapping during some periods of the MCMC.\n",

    "- **Posterior median**. There is 50% posterior probability that the true parameter lies below this value and 50% that it lies above it. Unlike the mean, it has the desirable property that the median of any transformation (e.g. logarithm) of the parameter equals the transformation of the median. This property is known as *invariance to transformation* and is shared with maximum likelihood estimates.\n",

It's best not to copy out `7.6E-4`, because this is not standard scientific notation. Copying out $7.6413\\times10^{-4}$ would imply (a) you are confident that the MCMC provides you with 5 significant figures of precision and (b) this level of precision is needed. BEAST helpfully provides a standard error of the mean. I got $3.6\\times10^{-6}$ which indicates that the true posterior mean, after accounting for the limited number of iterations of the MCMC, lies somewhere between the sample mean plus and minus two standard errors, i.e. $7.6413\\times10^{-4} \\pm 2\\times3.6\\times10^{-6} = (7.569\\times10^{-4}, 7.713\\times10^{-4})$. This indicates that only one or two significant figures are appropriate. To obtain greater precision combine more chains or run each chain for longer. As a guide, the precision increases only with the square root of the number of iterations, so 100 times as many iterations are needed for 10 times the precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained a posterior median of $7.6\\times10^{-4}$ as well. For symmetrical distributions, the mean and median will match, as here. For some reason, Tracer could not provide the posterior mode but it would probably have been similar."

In contrast, BEAST is able, when provided with a clock rate specified through the prior or estimated from informative data, to estimate a rooted tree in which the branch lengths are in calendar time.
